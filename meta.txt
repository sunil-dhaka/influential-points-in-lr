Variable name definitions::

    STACKLOSS - 10 times the percentage of ammonia going into the plant
                that escapes from the absoroption column
    AIRFLOW   - Rate of operation of the plant
    WATERTEMP - Cooling water temperature in the absorption tower
    ACIDCONC  - Acid concentration of circulating acid minus 50 times 10.

Details

“Obtained from 21 days of operation of a plant for the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitric acid (HNO3). The nitric oxides produced are absorbed in a countercurrent absorption tower”. (Brownlee, cited by Dodge, slightly reformatted by MM.)

Air Flow represents the rate of operation of the plant. Water Temp is the temperature of cooling water circulated through coils in the absorption tower. Acid Conc. is the concentration of the acid circulating, minus 50, times 10: that is, 89 corresponds to 58.9 per cent acid. stack.loss (the dependent variable) is 10 times the percentage of the ingoing ammonia to the plant that escapes from the absorption column unabsorbed; that is, an (inverse) measure of the over-all efficiency of the plant.
