# what it is about
- this repo is for course ppt that I did for the MTH689A course taught at IITK by Prof. Satya Prakash Singh
- it contains implementation and ppt files for the Prof. Cook's paper on Influential Observation in Linear Regression
- if you decide to read on this paper, these files might come in handy; at least I hope they will :)
